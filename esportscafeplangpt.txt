Determine Pricing: Set competitive prices for your gaming services. You can charge hourly, daily, or weekly rates for gaming sessions.

Hire Staff: Hire staff members who are knowledgeable about gaming, customer service, and can troubleshoot technical issues.

Promote Your Cafe: Use social media platforms, flyers, and posters to promote your cafe. You can also offer discounts, loyalty programs, and host gaming events to attract new customers.
